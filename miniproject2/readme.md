Mini Project 2 
==============

This is an independent project. In this project you will implement and learn a multi-layer neural 
network to fit the data from the given dataset generator. You may choose to use any of the methods 
that were taught in class to fit the data. You may choose to use any of the tricks and tips that 
were taught (or perhaps you read up on your own) to solve the problem as well. Your machine must be
implemented for the structure provided along with the[test script](test_script.py). A script similar
to the test script will be used (the data created might be from different but stylistically related
distributions) to evaluate your implementation. The lower the rmse score, the higher the grade that
you shall receive. The API documentation for the test script and other methods are provided with the
code itself in[napolean](http://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html) 
format, which is popular among most deep learning python programmers and is a common style guide.  
For all the methods that you create, appropriate documentation must be provided in similar style.


Installation
------------

Run the code ``test_script.py``. Have fun!
